# Water Abstraction Returns

The water-abstraction-returns service is a evolving solution to initially handle the returns required by water abstraction licences.

The service is developed in HAPI/NodeJS and backed by a Postgres SQL database.  All data is transferred via a REST API with JWT authentication.

## Development Team

This module was developed by the Water Resource Licensing Service team as part of a digital transformation project at [DEFRA](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs), a department of the UK government
